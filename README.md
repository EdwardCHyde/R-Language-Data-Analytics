# R-Language-Data-Analytics

# Overview
This project takes a dataset and analysis the data to answer a hypothesis

The dataset for this project is the gapminder. It contains countries, continents, year, life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita.

The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to use the R programming language at a beginning level and deepen my understanding of statistical analysis.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running, and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results
Questions about the data:
Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference in life expectancy because the United States and the United Kingdom?
Which continents have the highest lifespan growth?
Answers about the Data:
For the t-test a p-value of 0.7493 was found which indicates that there is no difference between the two countries.
The graph indicates that the Americas have the highest growth in life expectancy. 

# Development Environment
R studio was used to run and test the R code for my project.

Libraries:
dplyr and ggplot2 which help with plotting and accessing data from the dataset.
